## Backend

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Implements the application logic, builds REST/GraphQL APIs, integrates database operations, and ensures secure endpoints.
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs, manages, and optimizes the MySQL database schema, ensures data integrity and backups.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up Docker containers and GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows, manages deployment pipelines.
- **Security Specialist**: Ensures all security measures are implemented, including encryption, access control, and vulnerability monitoring.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates timelines, assigns tasks, and tracks project milestones for successful and timely delivery.

## Database Design

#### Entities and Relationships

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
  - A user can book multiple properties and post reviews.

- **Properties**
  - `id`, `owner_id`, `location`, `price`, `description`
  - A property is listed by a user and can have multiple bookings.

- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
  - A booking belongs to one user and one property.

- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - A user can post multiple reviews for properties they've booked.

- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
  - Each payment is linked to a specific booking.
 
## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Enables user registration, login, role assignment, and secure session management.
- **Property Management:** Allows property owners to list, update, and delete their rental properties.
- **Booking System:** Users can book available properties by selecting dates and making payments.
- **Review System:** After a booking, users can leave feedback to help others make informed choices.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Supports secure transactions and payment tracking.
- **Admin Panel:** Admin users can monitor system activity, manage users, and flag/report suspicious listings.

## API Security

#### Security Measures

- **Authentication:** Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Grants different access levels to users based on roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain time.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against injection attacks by sanitizing input.
- **HTTPS:** Ensures secure communication over the network.

### Why security is crucial?
- Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.
- Ensures secure financial transactions.
- Maintains platform trust and integrity.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a method of automating software delivery, from code commits to deployment.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deploying the app on every commit.
- **Docker**: Ensures the app runs in the same environment across development, staging, and production.
